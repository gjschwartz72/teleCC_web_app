### RULE Set
1) The primary key is PatientID, prediciton_datetime.  Each Patient ID has the same trial arm, patientName.  Duplicate data may exist if new data for patientID is entered on a new datetime and no other values change except the prediction_datetime.  Duplicate data will occur totaly at randomly with a propbablity of .2.
1.5) prediction_datetime should have a date starting 2024-12-01 00:00:00  There is no need to consider timezone.
2) Each patientID will be associated with the same Sta6a, PatientName and Trial Arm.  So if a patient has 10 values over 10 prediction_datime values, these variables will remain the same.
3) Trial Arm: 1 or 2. 50% of patientIDs should have 1 and 50% should have 2 
3.5) room.  a room number in the range of 1-10.  Keep this the same for each patientID.  Assign at random.
3.7) sta6a: Assign each patient to either (00123, 54321, 32999 or 41444).  Evenly distribut patients to these sta6a numbers within each simulation.
4) septic_shock_score: values between 0 and 1.  
5) septic_shock_class: A classificaton of septic_shock_score - {1: septic_shock_score <= .33, 2: .33 < septic_shock_score <= .66, 3: .66 < septic_shock_score}
6) respiratory_trend since last is 1, -1 or 0.  (1) if the previous entry set for the patientID (as determined by prediction_datetime) is less than current, (-1) if it is greater, and (0) if it is the same. If this is the first value, then null is recored.
7) respitory_score: values between 0 and 1
8) respitory_class: A classificaton of respitory_score - {0: respitory_score <= .33, 1: .33 < respitory_score <= .66, 2: .66 < respitory_score}
9) respiratory_trend since last is 1, -1 or 0.  (1) if the previous entry set for the patientID (as determined by prediction_datetime) is less than current, (-1) if it is greater, and (0) if it is the same. If this is the first value, then null is recored.
10) septic_shock_score_expl_pos_1, septic_shock_score_expl_pos_2, septic_shock_score_expl_pos_3: These are proportions ranging between 0 and 1 such that septic_shock_score_expl_pos_1 > septic_shock_score_expl_pos_2 > septic_shock_score_expl_pos_3 and septic_shock_score_expl_pos_1 + septic_shock_score_expl_pos_2 + septic_shock_score_expl_pos_3 <= 1.  Let the sum range between .75 and 1 at random.
11) septic_shock_score_expl_neg_1, septic_shock_score_expl_neg_2, septic_shock_score_expl_neg_3: These are proportions ranging between 0 and 1 such that septic_shock_score_expl_neg_1 > septic_shock_score_expl_neg_2 > septic_shock_score_expl_neg_3 and septic_shock_score_expl_neg_1 + septic_shock_score_expl_neg_2 + septic_shock_score_expl_neg_3 <= 1.  Let the sum range between .75 and 1 at random.
12) respitory_score_expl_pos_1, respitory_score_expl_pos_2, respitory_score_expl_pos_3: These are proportions ranging between 0 and 1 such that respitory_score_expl_pos_1 > respitory_score_expl_pos_2 > respitory_score_expl_pos_3 and respitory_score_expl_pos_1 + respitory_score_expl_pos_2 + respitory_score_expl_pos_3 <= 1.  Let the sum range between .75 and 1 at random.
13) respitory_score_expl_neg_1, respitory_score_expl_neg_2, respitory_score_expl_neg_3: These are proportions ranging between 0 and 1 such that respitory_score_expl_neg_1 > respitory_score_expl_neg_2 > respitory_score_expl_neg_3 and respitory_score_expl_neg_1 + respitory_score_expl_neg_2 + respitory_score_expl_neg_3 <= 1.  Let the sum range between .75 and 1 at random.


####
General instructions on distributions:
respitory_scores and septic_shock_score values should be generated using a uniform distribution between .1 and .99.

Records will be generated for a series of prediciton_datetime values starting at  2024-12-01.  The data will be simulated for every 2 hours for 28 days => 336 simulation cycles (28 days Ã— 12 cycles/day).  


Each simulation will have between 5 and 12 patients for each sta6a.  Initially these will all be new patients.
For each succesive simulation let patients stay or leave with probabilities of .9 and .1 respectively.
Once a patient leaves the simulation, they will not return.  There is no maxium time a patient can stay in the simulation.  The total patient count for a sta6a can be increase or decrease over time.

The values for septic_shock_score and respitory_score should be correlated.  Let 1/3 be negatively correlated (decreasing), 1/3 not correlated (random walk) and 1/3 positevely correlated (increasing).  In the increasing and decreasing trend, let there be enough variability such that a patient can be generally increasing, but see some decreasing along the way.  Choose an approprate trend and correlation.
 
For patientName, choose realistic male and female names.
